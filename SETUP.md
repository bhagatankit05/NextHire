# Interview Link Generation Fix - Setup Instructions

## Issue Resolved
The interview link generation was not working because:
1. Generated questions were not being saved to the database
2. No interview records were being created
3. No shareable interview links were being generated

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Created Save Interview API (`/app/api/save-interview/route.jsx`)
- Saves interview data to Supabase database
- Generates unique interview IDs using UUID
- Creates shareable interview links
- Returns interview link to the frontend

### 2. Updated Question List Component (`/app/(main)/dashboard/create-interview/_components/QuestionList.jsx`)
- Now saves generated questions to database
- Displays the generated interview link
- Provides copy and open link functionality
- Shows success confirmation when interview is created

### 3. Created Interview Page (`/app/interview/[id]/page.jsx`)
- Dynamic route for candidates to access interviews
- Candidate information collection form
- Displays interview questions
- Responsive design for interview taking

### 4. Updated Latest Interviews List (`/app/(main)/dashboard/_components/LatestInterviewsList.jsx`)
- Fetches and displays created interviews from database
- Shows interview details (position, duration, date)
- Provides copy link and view interview functionality

## Database Setup Required

Run the SQL commands in `database-schema.sql` in your Supabase database:

\`\`\`sql
-- Create Interviews table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Interviews" (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    job_position TEXT NOT NULL,
    job_description TEXT,
    duration INTEGER NOT NULL,
    interview_type JSONB,
    questions JSONB,
    created_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'completed'))
);
\`\`\`

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these environment variables are set:

\`\`\`
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 (or your production URL)
\`\`\`

## How It Works Now

1. **Create Interview**: User fills form with job details
2. **Generate Questions**: AI generates interview questions
3. **Save Interview**: Questions and details saved to database with unique ID
4. **Generate Link**: Shareable link created: `/interview/[unique-id]`
5. **Share Link**: Recruiters can copy and share the interview link
6. **Candidate Access**: Candidates use the link to take the interview

## Testing

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/create-interview`
3. Fill out the interview form
4. Complete the question generation process
5. You should now see:
   - Generated questions displayed
   - Green success message with interview link
   - Copy and Open buttons for the link
6. The interview link should work for candidates to access
